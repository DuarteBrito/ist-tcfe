\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


\par Unlike previous laboratories, this time, the results were not equal.

However, we believe that the differences are not that significant and they can be explained by how NGSpice solves the circuit compared to how it was done in the theoretical analysis. To solve the circuit, NGSpice used far more advanced simulation methods for the diodes, with many more parameters, while we used an approximated model with $V_{on}$ and an incremental resistor. 

This way, the objective should have never been to have equal results, but rather, have results that are "close enough", which we believe it was achieved.


%To sum up, we believe that the goals of this report were achieved.
