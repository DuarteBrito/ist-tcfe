\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Even though the theoretical and simulation models might not always give the same results, in
our case of study the outcomes were precisely matched. This was in line with what was expected 
since we were presented with linear components and, to solve the circuit, ngspice utilized the same methods 
as we did in the theoretical Octave calculation.
In conclusion, we believe that the goals of this report were achieved.
