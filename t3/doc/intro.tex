% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a converter circuit, in this case from alternate current (AC) to direct current (DC).
This circuit uses a transformer, a full wave rectifier, an envelope detector and a voltage regulator, which were chosen from the lectures.
The format of the circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:format}. And the circuit chosen can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:circuit}.

In Section~\ref{sec:simulation analysis}, the circuit is analysed by
means of a ngspice simulation. In Section~\ref{sec:theoretical analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. The results are then compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:theoretical analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
