Similar to the previous laboratory, the results of the theoretical ant simulation analysis were not equal.
However, we believe that the differences are not that significant and they can be explained by how NGSpice solves the circuit compared to how it was done in the theoretical analysis.

To solve the circuit, NGSpice used far more advanced simulation methods for the transistors, with many more parameters. 

This way, the objective should have never been to have equal results, but rather, have results that are "close enough", which we believe it was achieved.

Furthermore, one detrimental goal was to analyse and choose values for the circuit's elements that assure it's best and most optimal performance, which by taking into consideration the obtained data, we believe it was achieved.

%To sum up, we believe that the goals of this report were achieved.
