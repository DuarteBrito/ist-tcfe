% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study an audio amplifier.
This circuit is made up of a gain stage and an output stage.
The format of the circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:format}. And the  provided circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:circuit}.

In Section~\ref{sec:theoretical analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation analysis}, the circuit is analysed by
means of a ngspice simulation. The results are then compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:theoretical analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
