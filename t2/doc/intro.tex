% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing a voltage source $V_s$, 
a voltage dependent current source $I_b$, a current dependent voltage source 
$V_d$, 7 resistors $R_n$ and a capacitor $C$. The circuit can be seen if Figure~\ref{fig:circuit}.

In Section~\ref{sec:theoretical analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented, using both the nodal and mesh methods. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation analysis}, the circuit is analysed by
means of a ngspice simulation. The results are then compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:theoretical analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
